# ScheduleSPX Installation Instructions

If you see a message that "ScheduleSPX.app is damaged and can't be opened", this is due to macOS security features for apps without a developer signature.

To fix this:

1. After installing the app to your Applications folder, open Terminal
2. Copy and paste this command:
   xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/ScheduleSPX.app
3. Press Return

Alternatively:
- Right-click on ScheduleSPX.app
- Select "Open"
- Click "Open" when the warning appears
